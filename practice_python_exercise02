#This exercise was to build a program that would ask the user to input a number and then tell the user whether the number is odd or even.

number = input('Enter your favorite number!:')

fav = int(number)
if fav % 2 == 0:
    print('Your favorite number is even!')
elif fav % 2 != 0:
    print('Your favorite number is odd!')
    
print('Done.')
