#This exercise is to create a program that asks the user to enter their name and age and tells them what year they will be 100 years old.
name = input('Enter your name:')
age = input('How old are you?:')

try:
    yrs = int(age)
except:
    yrs = -1
if yrs < 0:
    print('Enter age as a number, please.')
    print("Done.")
else:
    yrs = yrs


    current_year = 2023
    birth_year = (current_year - yrs)
    year_100 = (birth_year) + 100

    print(name,'you will turn 100 years old in the year', year_100)
